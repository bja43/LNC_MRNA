Long-Non-Coding vs Coding

Takes a fasta file as input and outputs two files: 
sequences (which is a file of sequences in fasta format)
and predictions (which is a files of predictions that
correspond to the sequences in sequences). In order to run
the classification the global variables in pipeline.py must
be updated: LIBSVM should be changed to the path to the
directory containing the libsvm executables and WEKA should
be changed to the path to weka.jar.

Options:
-p input file for prediction  -- REQUIRED --
-t sequence length threshhold; default 200 
   (must be at least 200)
-n number of threads; default 1

Note -t must be at least 200 because a sequence of length
200 is required for a feature used in classification.
